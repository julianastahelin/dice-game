<h1>Dice game</h1>

<p>This is a dice game I built as an exercise to practice JS functions and adding animations to websites in the beggining of my study in web development. </p>
<p>I started from an exercise proposed by the course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?src=sac&kw=the+complete+2023">"The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp"</a> and added some functionalities like the dice animation and the "Throw dice!" button.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>The project</h3>
<p>This is a dice game. Upon button click, two dice are rolled, the first for player 1 and the second for player 2. When both dice are shown, the page tells the game result: either a draw or a victory for player 1 or player 2.</p>
